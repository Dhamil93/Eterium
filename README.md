# Learn-Selenium
The Selenium WebDriver 3.x is an open source API to test both browser and mobile applications. With a solid foundation, you can easily perform end-to-end testing on web and mobile browsers.

You’ll begin by getting introduced to the Selenium page object design patterns in software development. You’ll architect your own framework with a scalable driver class, Java utility classes, and support for third-party tools and plugins. You'll design and build a Selenium grid from scratch to enable the framework to scale and support different browsers, mobile devices, and platforms. You’ll strategize and handle rich web UI using the advanced WebDriver API and learn techniques to handle real-time challenges in WebDriver. You’ll perform different types of testing, such as cross-browser testing, load testing, and mobile testing. Finally, you will also be introduced to data-driven testing using TestNG to create your own automation framework.

By the end of this Learning Path, you’ll be able to design your own automation testing framework and perform data-driven testing with Selenium WebDriver.
